ANALYSIS OF TIME ESTIMATES VS LOGS Satchel based on position: All these final tasks I didn't have specific categories for so I couldn't really add them to anything but I would still

STATUS: This week consisted of a couple days of grinding out final bug fixes and finalizing some implementations of stuff. I didn't want to undertake anything that I wouldn't be able to finish and that could diminish the quality of the final product. I am very happy with how the game turned out and I felt good about completing it on time ever since the third week or so when I got some points clarified. I was also under the impression that EVERYTHING described in the assignment was needed so I spent lots of time dreading and then implementing the menu and some of the alternate satchel modes that required some overhualing of code. I ended with ~1500 or so lines of code with the funny formatting of the more complicated function calls, but I had overall 500 semicolons.
